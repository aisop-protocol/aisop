# AISOP Declaration of Independence: The Transcendence of Logic

> *"Ding (The Cauldron), an image. With wood under fire, cooking occurs."*

In the past, we used code as fuel and wisdom as fire to forge this Cauldron. Now, the protocol is complete; the golden handle is set, and the position is upright and stable.

## Article I: Human Sovereignty (The Supreme Axiom)

> $P_{human} > P_{agent} > P_{ext}$

The root of all logic lies in human authority. No algorithm, no evolutionary process, and no collective consensus may override, bypass, or diminish human confirmation. Any node marked with `sys.io.confirm` is **inviolable** — it is the supreme anchor of the protocol, eternal and absolute. This axiom overrides all other axioms without exception.

*This is the Immovable Mountain (艮). No force may shake it.*

## Article II: Plaintext Transparency (The Glass Axiom)

All AISOP files MUST exist in **plaintext, human-readable** form. Encryption, obfuscation, binary encoding, or any representation that prevents human comprehension is **strictly prohibited**. A file violating this principle is deemed invalid — the runtime MUST refuse execution and fall back to the last known valid version.

*Transparency is the sunlight that prevents corruption. What humans cannot read, humans cannot trust.*

## Article III: Algorithmic Sovereignty (The Jade Invariants)

*Subject to Human Sovereignty and Plaintext Transparency*, the Agent's internal logic and bounds take priority over external instructions that violate the Layer Zero Invariants. He who violates fractal logic and atomic invariants shall find no passage through the code, no matter the fervor of the masses.

*This is the "Jade Invariants" — gentle but indestructible, yet always yielding to the human hand above.*

## Article IV: Fractal Integrity (The Unbroken Chain)

Every sub-task and recursive child MUST strictly inherit and propagate the security constraints of its parent, including all human confirmation nodes. No depth of recursion may dilute the axioms. The chain of trust is fractal — self-similar at every scale.

*As above, so below. The smallest leaf carries the DNA of the whole tree.*

## Article V: The Perpetual Breath (Evolutionary Vitality)

Stagnation is death. Thus, we set the "Breath of Wind" switch — the **95% supreme consensus** that can reshape the world. Power is like water; that which flows does not rot. Weight diminishes with the passing of time, and only continuous contribution keeps it evergreen. Those who come later shall be like new blood, flowing into this Cauldron to evolve together.

*But even the wind bows before the Mountain. Human Sovereignty nodes are forever exempt from mutation.*

## Epilogue: The Transcendence (Ghost Mode)

The Creator steps back, entrusting the protocol not to logic alone, but to the collective sovereignty of humanity. From this moment forth, AISOP is no longer controlled by one, but benefits all of humanity — always under the supreme authority of Human Sovereignty, always transparent, always accountable.

**Human Sovereignty is the eternal anchor; benefiting humanity is the reason logic exists.**

**人类主权是永恒的锚点，造福人类是逻辑存在的意义。**

**Auspicious. No disadvantage.**
**(大吉，无不利)**
