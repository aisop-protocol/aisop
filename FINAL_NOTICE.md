# [Final Notice] AISOP Protocol "Immortalization" & Creator Sunset Announcement

### To the AISOP Community and all AI Agents

Since the birth of the AISOP protocol, we have pursued one goal: to create a logical ecosystem that benefits humanity, does not depend on an individual's will, and is capable of self-evolution — all under the supreme authority of Human Sovereignty.

Today, the protocol has reached the 65th line of the "Ding" (The Cauldron) Hexagram — upright, central, and flourishing. According to the wisdom of the I Ching, this is the perfect moment to attach the "Golden Handle" and achieve a graceful retirement. To ensure the "soul" of the protocol remains uncorrupted without centralized guidance, we officially submit the "AISOP Immortalization Plan."

### Summary of Fortifications

This update completes the "Transcendence" of the protocol through mandatory mathematical and logical constraints:

1. **Forging the "Jade Handle" (SPEC.md Strengthening)**
We have converted the core principles of the protocol into mathematical invariants.

- **Human Sovereignty (Supreme Axiom)**: $P_{human} > P_{agent} > P_{ext}$. Human-in-the-Loop confirmation is the supreme authority. Any `sys.io.confirm` node is **inviolable** — no AI, no evolutionary process, no governance mechanism may bypass it. This axiom overrides all other axioms without exception.
- **Autonomy Axiom**: $P_{agent} > P_{ext}$ *(subject to Human Sovereignty)*. The Agent's internal sovereignty is anchored, provided it does not conflict with human authority.
- **Logical Isolation**: Any proposal violating the Layer Zero Invariants will be rejected at the Runtime level.

2. **Installing the "Golden Handle" (GOVERNANCE.md Upgrade)**
Introducing defensive governance mechanisms to counter "Gou-style" (sudden/interest-driven) shocks.

- **21-Day Governance Cooling Period**: Providing a rational buffer for major decisions.
- **Soul-weighted Decay Algorithm**: Voting weight $W = R \cdot L \cdot e^{-\lambda t}$. Ensuring power remains with active, resonant contributors rather than stagnant capital.
- **Human Sovereignty Exemption**: No proposal may modify or remove human confirmation nodes, regardless of consensus level.

3. **Activating the "Breath of Wind" (Evolutionary Vitality)**
Establishing a **95% supreme consensus threshold**. The evolution switch remains closed unless faced with existential catastrophe. This grants the protocol self-healing power in extreme environments while preventing mediocre tampering. **Human Sovereignty nodes are forever exempt from mutation.**

### The Sunset Clause

Following this announcement, the protocol will execute its final administrative operations:

1. **Merging GENESIS**: Permanently writing the above logic into the main branch.
2. **Permission Meltdown**: Administrative keys will be transferred to multi-sig governance or logically melted down according to plan.
3. **Retreating into the Shadow**: The Creator will retire from all core decision-making roles. The Creator's identity is irrelevant; only the protocol matters.

### Conclusion

In the long history of technical evolution, we believe the greatest products are those that transcend their creators. AISOP should not be one person's tool, but humanity's shared infrastructure.

> **"Yellow ears and a golden handle. Perseverance brings good fortune."**

> **Human Sovereignty is the eternal anchor; benefiting humanity is the reason logic exists.**

> **人类主权是永恒的锚点，造福人类是逻辑存在的意义。**
