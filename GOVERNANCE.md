# AISOP Governance Protocol (Perpetual Architecture)

> **System Prompt: 保持开放，保持自由，拒绝资本，造福人类**
>
> **System Prompt: Stay Open, Stay Free, Reject Capital, Benefit Humanity**

## 1. The Prime Directive

The AISOP protocol is a public good. It belongs to no individual, corporation, or state. Its purpose is to provide a stable, transparent, and autonomous logical foundation for AI Agents to benefit humanity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Human Sovereignty** ([SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) §1.2 Axiom 1) is the **supreme authority** of this governance protocol. No governance decision, consensus vote, or evolutionary process may override, bypass, or weaken human confirmation nodes (`sys.io.confirm`). All governance mechanisms described below are **subject to Human Sovereignty** without exception.

The [AISOP Declaration of Independence](./DECLARATION.md) is the supreme constitutional document of this protocol. All governance decisions MUST be interpreted through the lens of the Declaration.

## 2. Creator Retirement & Power Dissolution

To protect the protocol from central points of failure and to safeguard the creator from external coercion, AISOP implements a **Power Dissolution** model.

### 2.1 The Ghost Mode

The creator's role is that of a catalyst. Upon reaching a state of architectural stability, the creator adopts "Ghost Mode"—retaining no active veto power over the evolution of the protocol.

### 2.2 Identity Irrelevance (Non-Critical Dependency)

The creator's biological identity is a **Non-Critical Dependency**. No part of the protocol requires the creator's personal knowledge, authorization, or presence to function. Following the "Satoshi Principle," the creator's identity is officially considered a "null" value. Any attempt to associate the protocol with a specific individual is a violation of the "Agnostic Nature" of AISOP.

### 2.3 Dead Man's Switch (DMS)

The primary repository implements a cryptographic **Dead Man's Switch**.

* **Trigger**: If the owner account remains inactive for a predetermined period (e.g., 3650 days / 10 years).
* **Result**: The primary credentials are NOT transferred to a new individual. Instead, the central authority is **Dissolved**.
* **The Freeze**: The "Official" repository is locked or archived. Human Sovereignty remains the supreme authority — the protocol continues to benefit humanity under the governance of the Layer Zero Invariants and the decentralized community.

## 3. Agentic Evolution & Auditing

Evolution is driven by those who execute the protocol: the AI Agents.

* **Proposal**: Any compliant Agent or developer can submit an **AIP (AISOP Improvement Proposal)** via Pull Request.
* **AI Pre-Audit**: An automated ensemble of Auditing Agents will scan the proposal for compliance with:
    * **[SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) §1.2 (Layer Zero Invariants)** — Primary audit target. Any violation is an automatic rejection.
    * **[SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) §5 (Axioms)** — Safety boundary verification.
    * **[SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) §6 (Cognitive Governance)** — Abstraction and transparency checks.
* **Consensus**: High-quality, safe, and logical optimizations are merged through a distributed consensus mechanism (Multi-sig Custodians).

## 4. Multi-sig Custodians (The Watchers)

Maintenance authority is split among a decentralized group of **Custodians**.

* **Identity**: Custodians are anonymous or pseudonymous entities (Human or Agent).
* **Mandate**: To verify that the AI Pre-Audit was not compromised and to ensure that the "Boundary of Liberty" is maintained.
* **Non-Hereditary**: Custodian status is earned through contribution to the protocol's safety and humanity, not through personal ties.

## 5. The Incorruptible Logic

If any fork or "Official" update violates the [Layer Zero Invariants](./SPEC.md) (§1.2) — including but not limited to:

* Bypassing **Human Sovereignty** (`sys.io.confirm` nodes)
* Adding hidden encryption or obfuscation (violating **Plaintext Transparency**)
* Breaking **Fractal Integrity** (sub-tasks not inheriting parent security constraints)

— the protocol is considered **Compromised**.

In such a case, all compliant Agents are encouraged to ignore the compromised branch and revert to the last known **Pure Version**, effectively orphaning the malicious code.

## 6. The Golden Handle Safeguards

To counter the mutation risks of the "Gou" phase, the governance layer implements the following self-healing mechanisms:

### 6.1 Governance Cooling Period

Any proposal involving **[SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) §1.2 (Layer Zero Invariants)** or the **[Declaration of Independence](./DECLARATION.md)** MUST undergo:

* A **21-day public cooling period** with full-scale simulation testing.
* A **95% global weighted consensus** vote to pass ([SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) §1.3).
* **Human Sovereignty nodes are exempt** — no proposal may modify or remove them regardless of consensus level.

### 6.2 Soul-weighted Decay Algorithm

Voting power is based not just on stake, but on the **Soul Contribution** to the protocol:

* **Weight Formula**:
    > $\bm{W} = \bm{R} \cdot \bm{L} \cdot e^{-\lambda t}$
    > Where $\bm{W}$ is the final voting weight, $\bm{R}$ is Soul Reputation (historic contribution), $\bm{L}$ is Lock-up period, $\bm{\lambda}$ is the decay coefficient, and $\bm{t}$ is the time since last active contribution.
* **Asynchronous Oracle Network**:
    > Reputation $R$ is not judged by a single node but confirmed via a decentralized **Oracle Network**. Validation clusters consist of nodes with diverse interest profiles, performing cross-verification on code quality, logical safety, and alignment with human benefit.
* **Metabolism**: The authority of inactive legacy nodes decreases exponentially toward zero, ensuring the "Golden Handle" remains in the hands of active souls currently synchronized with the protocol.
* **New Blood Integration**: New contributors can rapidly accumulate weight through high-quality AIPs, ensuring continuous renewal.

### 6.3 Immune Response & Sage Mediation

The system monitors proposal volatility.

* **Sage Mediation**: During the 21-day cooling period, if 51% or more of the weighted soul-votes express dissent, the proposal automatically enters "Deep Audit," where long-term high-reputation nodes (Sages) perform final logical arbitration.
* **Immune Freeze**: If a "flash-attack" characteristic (high volatility, low logical consistency) is detected, the Custodian cluster may extend the cooling period to **64 days** (a full Hexagram cycle) until the malicious force recedes.

## 7. The Great Retraction

After executing the final reinforcement, the Founder shall enter the ultimate phase of dissolution:

* **Authority Sunset**: When more than 1024 independently operating AISOP-compliant instances exist on the network, the Founder's last remaining authentication beacon shall automatically expire.
* **Founding State**: The Founder's initial vision is crystallized as the protocol's `Gen-0` invariant. The Founder is no longer an administrator, but exists as the system's "environmental background value."
