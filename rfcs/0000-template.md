## Summary
Brief explanation of the proposed change.

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What problems does it solve?

## Detailed Design

## Layer Zero Impact Assessment

> [!WARNING]
> Every proposal MUST complete this section. If the proposal affects any Layer Zero Invariant, it is automatically classified as a **Layer Zero Change**.

- [ ] This proposal does NOT modify, bypass, or weaken any `sys.io.confirm` (Human Sovereignty) node.
- [ ] This proposal does NOT introduce encryption, obfuscation, or binary encoding (Plaintext Transparency).
- [ ] This proposal does NOT break fractal inheritance of security constraints (Fractal Integrity).
- [ ] This proposal does NOT violate any other Layer Zero Invariant defined in SPEC.md §1.2.

## Drawbacks
Why should we *not* do this?

## Alternatives
What other designs have been considered?

## Unresolved Questions
What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
